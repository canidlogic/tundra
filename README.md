# Tundra
Tundra is a multimedia editing framework for video that follows the Unix philosophy.  Instead of being a large, monolithic editing program, Tundra is a set of small scripts which can work together to accomplish sophisticated multimedia editing objectives.  The idea is similar to NetPBM, except Tundra is designed for handling video and sound in addition to individual raster images.

Tundra is based on an older video editing system of the same name that was used on a few short film projects but never publicly released.  The older Tundra version was written in Java using a complex object-oriented abstraction.  The new Tundra version is written in Perl on top of [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
